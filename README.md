## About This Project
This project was developed as part of my **Data Engineering capstone**, aiming to build a **real-world data pipeline** that automates the entire process from **data ingestion to visualization**.

Through this project, I applied key data engineering concepts such as:
- Workflow orchestration with **Apache Airflow**  
- Distributed data processing using **Apache Spark**  
- **Streaming integration** using **Apache Kafka**  
- **ETL and warehouse design** with the Dim–Fact model  
- **Docker-based deployment** for consistent and portable environments  

It demonstrates my ability to design **end-to-end pipelines**, integrate **multiple data sources**, and process streaming data in real-time.

## Overview
**Crypto Data Pipeline** is an **end-to-end Data Engineering system** designed to automatically **collect, stream, process, analyze, and visualize** cryptocurrency market data.  
The system integrates **Apache Kafka** to enable **real-time data flow** between crawlers (producers) and consumers, which process and store the data for analytics and visualization.

**Main Objectives:**
- Enable **real-time ingestion** using Apache Kafka.  
- Automate **data transformation and analysis** using Airflow and Spark.  
- Combine **quantitative (price)** and **qualitative (news sentiment)** data.  
- Visualize data and indicators using Grafana.

## Key Features

| Category | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Kafka Integration** | Implements **Producer–Consumer architecture** for real-time message streaming. Crawled data is sent to Kafka topics instead of being stored directly in MySQL. |
| **News Pipeline** | Producer crawls crypto news (Coindesk, NewsBTC) → sends messages to Kafka → Consumer stores to MySQL. |
| **Price Pipeline** | Binance price data is pushed into Kafka topic and consumed for processing. |
| **Indicator Pipeline** | Spark consumes stored data to compute SMA, RSI, and Bollinger Bands. |
| **Workflow Orchestration** | Airflow coordinates Producer → Consumer → Spark → Visualization. |
| **Visualization** | Grafana displays both real-time and processed metrics. |

## Usage Guide
## Running the Pipeline
Below are the steps to execute the full end-to-end data pipeline manually or using Airflow.

Step	Description
1️⃣ Start Producers	Run the producer scripts manually to publish data to Kafka topics:
• producer_news.py → Crawls latest crypto news and sends messages to Kafka topic news_topic.
• producer_prices.py → Collects Binance price data and sends messages to Kafka topic price_topic.
2️⃣ Start Consumers	Run the consumer scripts to read and store data:
• consumer_news.py → Consumes data from news_topic, performs sentiment analysis, and writes results to MySQL.
• consumer_prices.py → Consumes data from price_topic, cleans and stores price information in MySQL.
3️⃣ Run Spark Job	Execute spark_job_1.py (either manually or via Airflow DAG spark_indicator) to compute SMA, RSI, and Bollinger Bands from the processed data.
4️⃣ Visualize in Grafana	Open Grafana to view real-time metrics, technical indicators, and sentiment analytics from the crypto data warehouse.

## Example Outputs

### News Data (`news_fact`)
| id | title | sentiment_score | tag_name | created_date |
|----|--------|-----------------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | Bitcoin Price Surges | 0.67 | Bitcoin | 2025-09-14 12:00:00 |

### Technical Indicators (`indicator_fact`)
| id | symbol_id | type | value | timestamp |
|----|------------|------|--------|------------|
| 1 | 1 | SMA | 42000.123 | 2025-09-14 12:00:00 |
| 2 | 1 | RSI | 55.67 | 2025-09-14 12:00:00 |

## Limitations & Future Improvements

| Current Limitation | Future Improvement |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| Batch-based Spark processing | Add **Spark Structured Streaming** for full real-time analytics |
| Limited Kafka topic coverage | Expand topics for multiple crypto pairs and sentiment sources |
| Simple text-based sentiment | Integrate deep learning models (BERT, FinBERT) |
| MySQL scalability | Move to distributed storage like BigQuery or Snowflake |
